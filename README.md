This game allows you to play 5 rounds of rock paper scissors against a computer.

This project was designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow me to become more familiar with creating full-stack websites without the use of a framework. I was able to apply the foundations of each language I learned from The Odin Project to help create this game. Specifically by working with the DOM and event handlers.
